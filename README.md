InstaDough is an exchange site for crowd-sourced stock photos
Hook up your Instagram account and you're ready to buy and sell photos with other people on the site.
InstaDough lets casual photographers monetize their work, attracts would-be
stock photo customers with simple needs and low budgets, and taps a vast wealth of private, user-generated images that would otherwise
be unavailable.

-allows users to link instagram account and sell photos to others with payments through Capital One (and a stretch goal of Bitcoin)

NOTE: To set up sqlite database, run:
